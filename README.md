# ArWordVec: efficient word embedding models for Arabic tweets

ArWordVec is a collection of pre-trained word embedding model built from huge repository of Arabic tweets in different topics. The aim of these models is to support the community in their Arabic NLP-based research. In order to build an efficient word embedding model on Twitter Arabic data, we decided to collect millions of tweets frommultiple domains and hashtags to boost theword embedding model with the diverse usage of the words within the different topics. We collected about 55 Million tweets within different topics covering the educational domain, health care, politics, social affairs, etc. as shown below.
